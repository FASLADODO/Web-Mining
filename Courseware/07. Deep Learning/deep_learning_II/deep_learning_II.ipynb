    "\n",
    "### 4.1. Word2Vector\n",
    " - Vector representation of words (i.e. word vectors) learned using neural network\n",
    "   - e.g. \"apple\" : [0.35, -0.2, 0.4, ...], 'mongo':  [0.32, -0.18, 0.5, ...]\n",
    "   - Interesting properties of word vectors:\n",
    "    * **Words with similar semantics have close word vectors**\n",
    "    * **Composition**: e.g. vector(\"woman\")+vector(\"king\")-vector('man') $\\approx$ vector(\"queen\")\n",
    " - Models:\n",
    "   - **CBOW** (Continuous Bag of Words): Predict a target word based on context\n",
    "     - e.g. the fox jumped over the lazy dog\n",
    "     - Assuming symmetric context with window size 3, this sentence can create training samples: \n",
    "       - ([-, fox], the) \n",
    "       - ([the, jumped], fox) \n",
    "       - ([fox, over], jumped)\n",
    "       - ([jumped, the], over) \n",
    "       - ...\n",
    "       \n",
    "       <img src=\"cbow.png\" width=\"50%\">\n",
    "       source: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/06/word-embeddings-count-word2veec/\n",
    "   - **Skip Gram**: predict context based on target words\n",
    "   \n",
    "        <img src=\"skip_gram.png\" width=\"50%\">\n",
    "        source: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/06/word-embeddings-count-word2veec/\n",
    "   - Nagtive Sampling: \n",
    "       - When training a neural network, for each sample,  all weights are adjusted slightly so that it predicts that training sample more accurately. \n",
    "       - CBOW or skip gram models have tremendous number of weights, all of which would be updated slightly by every one of billions of training samples!\n",
    "       - Negative sampling addresses this by having **each training sample only modify a small percentage of the weights, rather than all of them**. \n",
    "       - e.g. when training with sample ([fox, over], jumped), update output weights connected to \"jumped\" along with a small number of other \"negative words\" sampled randomly\n",
    "       - For details, check http://mccormickml.com/2017/01/11/word2vec-tutorial-part-2-negative-sampling/\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src='cnn.png' width='70%'>\n",
    "\n",
    "- A CNN typically contains:\n",
    "  - A **convolution layer** (not dense layer) connected to the input layer\n",
    "      - Each convolution layer applies different filters. \n",
    "      - Typically hundreds or thousands filters used. \n",
    "      - The results of filters are concatenated.\n",
    "  - A **pooling layer** is used to subsample the result of convolution layer\n",
    "  - There may be multiple layers of convolution and pooling combined. E.g. image detection\n",
    "    - 1st layer: detect edges\n",
    "    - 2nd layer: detect shape, e.g. round, square\n",
    "    - 3rd layer: wheels, doors etc.\n",
    "  - Then each result out of convolution-pooling is connected to a neuron in the output (local connections). Such  results results are high-level features used by classification algorithms. \n",
    "- During the training phase, a CNN **automatically learns the values of its filters based on the task you want to perform**. \n",
    "- Powerful capabilities of CNN:\n",
    "  - **Location Invariance**: CNN extracts distinguishing features by convolution-pooling and it does not care where these features are. So images can still be recognized after rotation and scaling.\n",
    "  - **Compositionality**: Each filter composes a local patch of lower-level features into higher-level representation. E.g., detect edges from pixels, shapes from edges, and more complex objects from shapes. \n",

    "- Assume $m$ samples, each of which is a sentence with $n$ words (short sentences can be padded)\n",
    "- **Embedding**: In each sentence, each word can be represented as its word vector of dimension $d$ (pretrained or to be trained)\n",
    "- **Convolution**: Apply filters to n-grams of different lengths (e.g. unigram, bigrams, ...). \n",
    "   - E.g. A filter can slide through every 2 words (bigram)\n",
    "   - So, the filter size (i.e. region size) can be $1\\text{x}d$ (unigram), $2\\text{x}d$ (bigram), $3\\text{x}d$ (trigram), ...\n",
    "- At pooling layer, 1-max pooling is applied to the result of each filter. Then all results after pooling are concatenated as the input to the output layer\n",
    "  - This is equivalent to select words or phrases that are **discriminative** with regard to the classification goal\n",

    "*Illustration of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for sentence classification. Here we depict three filter region sizes: 2, 3 and 4, each of which has 2 filters. Every filter performs convolution on the sentence matrix and generates (variable-length) feature maps. Then 1-max pooling is performed over each map, i.e., the largest number from each feature map is recorded. Thus a univariate feature vector is generated from all six maps, and these 6 features are concatenated to form a feature vector for the penultimate layer. The final softmax layer then receives this feature vector as input and uses it to classify the sentence; here we assume binary classification and hence depict two possible output states.
