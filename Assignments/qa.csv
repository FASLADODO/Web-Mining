Why does Zebras have stripes?,this provides camouflage - predator vision is such that it is usually difficult for them to see complex patterns
Do animals have a sense of humour?,"Dogs don't think that way. You're projecting human thought patterns and behaviours onto animals, and that's simply not how their mind works. I read a great article about a month ago (I forget where) about an animal psychologist talking about this sort of thing, how a lot of problems with pets are caused by thinking about them in human terms. For example, one woman's dog started causing havok when she got a full-time job and left him home in the house. She thought he was angry at her, but that's not something dogs could even comprehend. No, it was rather that the dog was simply very confused and didn't understand what was going on, and figuring this out saved the dog from having to be put down (he almost bit someone).\n\nBasically, no. Chimpanzees and other such evolutionary cousins might, but your common house pets cannot think that way."
Is the universe flat?,"Yes, the Universe is flat. It's a VERY difficult thing for most people to wrap their head around. You're Correct.\nJust because you see a round ball, does not necessitate the ball being round. I think the real question is...""Why can't we see it"" Einstein said that Reality is a thin, yet persistant veil. Good Luck."
What is the U.S. Green card procedure after labor certificate approval and how much time it will take?,"This depends mainly on which state you are . Usually the more immigrants like Texas, California , Florida could take 7 to 15 months. Other states with few cases could be shorter. If you've got the labor permit I believe you are more than halfway in the process, once you start the i485 ( not sure if the correct number) you are done , just a matter of wait. The more  important document you need in this stage is the travel document or travel parole that is only valid for one year and take slike two months to renew so you need to apply every 10 months. with thia paper you are free to move outside of the US and comeback. You do not need a visa anymore just wait until your residence card is ready."

WHY MOST OF THE CANCER TYPES MAKE METASTASIS IN BONE?,"Some cancers are more prone to metastasis to the bones than others.  Blood supply is an issue in transporting the cells, but the chemical environment of the bones also plays a part.  See the references below:"
why is the sky blue?,It's because sunlight striking air molecules is scattered in all directions.
I am a foreignerin the US. Can I temporarily drive with my foreign license or do I need some documentation?,"If you are in the United States visiting, most states will recognize the license of your parent country.  A non-resident student may also drive on an out-of-state or foreign license.  Many states require that you carry a passport in addition to your license for it to be valid.\n\nIf you are establishing residence in the United States, each state has a limit on the amount of time you have to get a license.  For instance, in Georgia, a new resident has 30 days to obtain a license."
how often does the president visit Bethesda Naval hospital?,"Whenever a full routine checkup is scheduled. \n\nRegular or emergency treatments are also available, for instance Bill Clinton visited in 1996 after multiple cocaine overdoses and was informed that his nasal septum would be destroyed with further use."
What body of water does the Yukon River empty into?,"It flows North (odd, huh?), so it empties into the Bering Sea."
the speed of life including the speed?,According to the Theory of Relativity it depends on you point of reference.
What color is water really?,"The absorption minimum for water is at 420 nm, well within the blue range of the visual spectrum. This means that that is the wavelength of light that it reflects the most. It does not reflect it very much, so small amounts appear transparent."
what bright planet is often mistaken for a UFO?,"Both murcery and jupiter are often mistaken for such an event.\n\nOn rare occasions during the clearnes of the night, saturn can be seen quite nicely and is oft mistaken by those using telescops."
What would be a better country to live in besides the United States?,UAE
is gas milage better in cold weather.does gas expand giving you more.?,"Gas mileage is usually worse in the cold weather. In the cold weather your tire pressure is lower and causes more friction with the ground. \n\nAlso the type of gasoline you put in your car is different in the summer and winter. Summer fuel is required to have a lower RVP, to mitigate evaporative emissions caused by higher temperatures. It is literally heavier, with more chemical bonds in the fuel molecules... more bonds to break = higher energy content = better MPG.\n\nAnd finally your car also faces more friction driving through cold air because the colder the air is the more dense it is."
why the sky is blue?,"The blue color of the sky is due to Rayleigh scattering. As light moves through the atmosphere, most of the longer wavelengths pass straight through. Little of the red, orange and yellow light is affected by the air.\n\nHowever, much of the shorter wavelength light is absorbed by the gas molecules. The absorbed blue light is then radiated in different directions. It gets scattered all around the sky. Whichever direction you look, some of this scattered blue light reaches you. Since you see the blue light from everywhere overhead, the sky looks blue."

What Does AAFES stand for?,Army and Air Force Exchange Service
why salt will be spread on snowy days?,"Contrary to popular belief, salt does not react with ice to make water. Instead, since salt can be soluble in water, it lowers the freezing point to about 0 degrees Farenheit. So as long as it is above 0 degrees outside, salt water won't freeze on the roads."
Who is the current president of south africa?,"Thabo Mbeki\n\nOn June 2, 1999, Mbeki, the pragmatic deputy president of South Africa and leader of the African National Congress, was elected president in a landslide, having already assumed many of Mandela's governing responsibilities shortly after Mandela won South Africa's first democratic election in 1994."

Do you think the US will ever recover from bad foreign politics and regain some international respect again?,"Leadership has to change for that to start. Even then, it's going to be difficult."
Is space infinite?,"Here's the issue:  The finite mind has no hope of apprehending the infinite.  We can define space ""\n\nMathematics. A set of elements or points satisfying specified geometric postulates: non-Euclidean space. \nThe infinite extension of the three-dimensional region in which all matter exists. \n\nThe expanse in which the solar system, stars, and galaxies exist; the universe. \nThe region of this expanse beyond Earth's atmosphere. \n\nAn extent or expanse of a surface or three-dimensional area: Water covered a large space at the end of the valley. \nA blank or empty area: the spaces between words. \nAn area provided for a particular purpose: a parking space. \nReserved or available accommodation on a public transportation vehicle. \n\nA period or interval of time. \nA little while: Let's rest for a space. \nSufficient freedom from external pressure to develop or explore one's needs, interests, and individuality: “The need for personal space inevitably asserts itself” (Maggie Scarf). \nMusic. One of the intervals between the lines of a staff. \nPrinting. One of the blank pieces of type or other means used for separating words or characters. \nOne of the intervals during the telegraphic transmission of a message when the key is open or not in contact. \nBlank sections in printed material or broadcast time available for use by advertisers.""\n\nThis is a defineable term because the finite mind percieves it as a finite entity with physical properties.  Space has a potential to either be filled or be empty.  Infinity cannot be bounded thus because it is unboundable and therefor indefineable.  If you were to ask is the universe infinite one could only, thoughtfully, respond ""No"".  This conclusion will be arrived at when the respondant considers that the universe has a definition applied to it and therefore a value that can be discussed and modeled.  You can discuss what is out side the universe, when the universe was created, etc.  Not so with infinity.  Infinity, as best I can discuss it (which is not very well as I am a finite being), is simultaneously all things existing and all things never existing.  The base problem with my definition is that ""things"" and ""existence"" are finite concepts fitting within the bounds of perception.  Infinity must be something other than that.  Are you beginning to see the issues with a discussion of infinity?  Try this one, ""Infinity is all unthings non-existing"".  that's the closest I can get.  Give it a shot.  But recognize that anything within the perceivable physical reality isn't infinite."
Do animals see colours?,"It actually depends on the animal!\n\nThe eye consists of Rods and Cones.  Rods handle detail.  They are the most sensitive. That is why cats can see intricate detail, such as the predicted direction of the jumping of a mouse due to muscle twitches, than to if the mouse is white, black or orange.  Cones handle colors.\n\nSee the source for better definition\n\nOn a side note... visible light is just a small part of the electomagnetic spectrum.  Some animals can see infrared, but are blind to purples, while others cant see red, but see ultraviolet light!"
What really provoke cancer beside smoking?,"There are many carcinogens (cancer causing chemicals). The source below has a list. Besides chemicals, sun exposure, especially staying in the sun until burning is the leading cause of skin cancer. Chewing tobacco causes throat and mouth cancer. Exposure to radiation of a variety of sorts causes system-wide cancers. Human pappillomavirus causes cervical cancer.\n\nBeyond direct causes, there are many genetic predispositions that can make it more possible to have cancer. Basically, there are thousands of different things that can cause cancer. The site below has more information."
Why do I sneeze everytime i see a bright light?,It is caused when you go from dim light to very bright light and your pupils are not able to reduce in time to cope with this extra light. In order that this light wont burn your retinas your body forces your eyes closed by making you sneeze. This commonly happens when you go from your reasonably dark lit house out onto a sunny street or if you turn on your beside lamp in the dark.
Why have have we not been contacted by et's yet?,"Earth has become an exothermal radio planet only a little over a century ago. Anyone who might listen in will take some time to make any sense of the increased radio activity, then could answer the same way. So far we can be fairly sure that noone within some 50 lightyears has answered."
the number of x-ray reaching the film will be higher if the?,"Answer 3.\n\nThe number of x-ray events is directly dependent on the mA setting - each electron will cause an x-ray quant as it is decelerated.\n\nHigher kVp will make the x-rays more energetic, i.e. less likely to interact with light elements on their way to the film.\n\nLow atomic number means that only softer radiation can be absorbed by the atom, creating less of a white shadow on the film."
What are the goofy laws in oklahoma for?,"I'm not from Oklahoma but I can tell you that most goofy laws were set forth due to someone actually committing something relating to them or someone complaining about a situation that happened simular to it.  In turn if they had enough power or knew someone in power, they were able to get the law passed.   \n\nAnother fact is that most bureaucrats will be able to get redicilious laws passed in order to have a particular business flourish.  A great example of this is the illegalization of marijuana.  It is sad but it does happen....\n\nIf you are interested in Oklahoma's nutty laws here is a list of them...you would be surprised that the other 49 states including other countries have just, if not more idiocy.......enjoy but at the same time cry.....\n\nRemember these are ACTUAL Laws!    \n\n:)\nPeace!\n--------------------------------------------------\nIt is illegal to have the hind legs of farm animals in your boots. \n\nDogs must have a permit signed by the mayor in order to congregate in groups of three or more on private property. \n\nIt is illegal to wear your boots to bed. \n\nFish may not be contained in fishbowls while on a public bus. \n\nTissues are not to be found in the back of one's car. \n\nOklahoma will not tolerate anyone taking a bite out of another's hamburger. \n\nNo one may spit on a sidewalk. \n\nFemales are forbidden from doing their own hair without being licensed by the state. \n\nCars must be tethered outside of public buildings.

how did betelgeuse get it's name?,"The name Betelgeuse is a corruption of the Arabic ""yad al jauza,"" which means the ""hand of al-jauza,"" al-jauza the ancient Arabs' ""Central One,"" a mysterious woman.\nAnother theory is Betelguese and the related names derive from the Arabic phrase Ibt al Jauzah meaning ""The Armpit of the Central One"".  The designation Al Mankib means in Arabic ""The Shoulder"". \nSee second reference for diagram:"
what is 13 SEER energy mandate?,"There’s a New Minimum Efficiency Standard for 2006\nLike many consumer products that use energy, air conditioners and heat pumps are manufactured to meet or exceed minimum efficiency standards set by the U.S. Department of Energy. For nearly a decade, that minimum has been 10 SEER (Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio). On January 23, 2006, the minimum will jump to 13 SEER, a 30% increase over the current standard."
do emergency room doctors get paid a lot?,"ER docs get paid slightly above average in comparison to other doctors.  However, they work shorter hours than most physicians and generally do not have to take ""call"" (in other words, once they are off work, they are off work).  They do not have to know everything, if you are comparing to doctors in other fields.  (All physicians have to know a little about every field, but no doctor knows everything about every field).  They just need to know how to recognize a wide variety of conditions that present in the ER, and know when to refer a patient to a specialist.\n\nThis is not to downplay the level of knowledge that ER docs have in comparison to other physicians.  ER docs often do well in their medical school class.  But there are other fields that are more competitive and are generally paid more (such as neurosurgery, cardiothoracic surgery, and orthopedic surgery)\n\nIn general, doctors working in a hospital are not paid as well as doctors in private practice.  Many, many people are treated at the hospital without health insurance (it would be unethical to turn them away).  This leaves hospitals cramped for money, so other patients' bills go up and doctors salaries go down, despite what the general public may think.\n\nAlso, when people discuss physician salaries, they often forget to factor in malpractice insurance, which has bankrupt and put many doctors out of business.  ...and yet so many people still want to sue doctors because they think they earn a lot of money."

Which was the worst earthquake to hit ever?,"There are, of course, different ways to define ""worst"". It could be the most property damage, most loss of life, most powerful at its focus (the actual origin of the quake), or most powerful at its epicenter (the place on the Earth directly above the focus).\n\nPrior to recent times, no one had accurate instruments to measure energy released in an earthquake, and no one kept accurate records of damage. The longer ago an earthquake occurred, and the less developed the area where it occurred, the less we know about it. Information regarding after shocks and duration is usually not available.\n\nGood sources for information are:\n\nhttp://wwwneic.cr.usgs.gov/neis/eqlists/eqsmosde/html or\nhttp://www.usgs.gov and click on “Earthquake.”\n\nAccording to them (the U.S. Geological Survey National Earthquake Information Center)\n\nMost Destructive Known Earthquakes on Record in the World\n                         (50,000 deaths or more)\n             (Listed in order of greatest number of deaths)\n\n\nDate               Location            Deaths    Mag    Comments\n\nJanuary 23, 1556   China, Shansi       830,000 \n\nOctober 11, 1737   India, Calcutta**   300,000\n\nJuly 27, 1976      China, Tangshan     255,000*  8.0\n\nAugust 9, 1138     Syria, Aleppo       230,000\n\nMay 22, 1927       China, near Xining  200,000   8.3  Large fractures.\n\nDecember 22, 856+  Iran, Damghan       200,000\n\nDecember 16, 1920  China, Gansu        200,000   8.6  Major fractures,\n                                                      landslides.\n\nMarch 23, 893+     Iran, Ardabil       150,000\n\nSeptember 1, 1923  Japan, Kwanto       143,000   8.3  Great Tokyo fire.\n\nOctober 5, 1948    USSR                110,000   7.3\n   (Turkmenistan, Ashgabat)\n\nDecember 28, 1908  Italy, Messina       70,000   7.5  Deaths from \n                                    to 100,000        earthquake and \n                                    (estimated)       tsunami.\n    \nSeptember, 1290    China, Chihli       100,000 \n\nNovember, 1667     Caucasia, Shemakha   80,000\n\nNovember 18, 1727  Iran, Tabriz         77,000\n\nNovember 1, 1755   Portugal, Lisbon     70,000   8.7  Great tsunami.\n\nDecember 25, 1932  China, Gansu         70,000   7.6\n\nMay 31, 1970       Peru                 66,000   7.8  $530,000 damage,\n                                                      great rock slide,\n                                                      floods.\n\n    1268           Asia Minor, Silicia  60,000\n\nJanuary 11, 1693   Italy, Sicily        60,000\n\nMay 30, 1935       Pakistan, Quetta     30,000   7.5  Quetta almost\n                                     to 60,000        completely destroyed.\n\nFebruary 4, 1783   Italy, Calabria      50,000\n\nJune 20, 1990      Iran                 50,000   7.7  Landslides.\n\n* Official casualty figure--estimated death toll as high as 655,000.\n+ Note that these dates are prior to 1000 AD.

Is the concept of spider-man real through our technology of genetic engineering and gene splicing?,"I don't think so.\n\nFor one thing, even if one could transfer the genetic materials correctly, there is no way a human could have the ""proportional strength of a spider"" or ant or anything like that. The physical nature of muscules will not scale up like that. The strongest one could get is, well, as strong as the strongest human, whoever that is.\n\nThe web material seems fictional as well. For one thing, what sort of glad (or tiny device) could generate so much material without either (1) lots of refills, (2) a huge tank."
Would the US constitution be changed if the admendment received 2/3 of the popular vote.?,"No.  Popular vote has nothing to do with it.\n\nThere are two methods:\n\nThe first method is for a bill to pass both halves of the legislature, by a two-thirds majority in each. Once the bill has passed both houses, it goes on to the states. This is the route taken by all current amendments. Because of some long outstanding amendments, such as the 27th, Congress will normally put a time limit (typically seven years) for the bill to be approved as an amendment (for example, see the 21st and 22nd).\n\nThe second method prescribed is for a Constitutional Convention to be called by two-thirds of the legislatures of the States, and for that Convention to propose one or more amendments. These amendments are then sent to the states to be approved by three-fourths of the legislatures or conventions. This route has never been taken, and there is discussion in political science circles about just how such a convention would be convened, and what kind of changes it would bring about."
what is the definition of vacuole?,"Vacuoles are membrane-bound sacs within the cytoplasm of a cell that function in several different ways. In mature plant cells, vacuoles tend to be very large and are extremely important in providing structural support, as well as serving functions such as storage, waste disposal, protection, and growth. Many plant cells have a large, single central vacuole that typically takes up most of the room in the cell (80 percent or more). Vacuoles in animal cells, however, tend to be much smaller, and are more commonly used to temporarily store materials or to transport substances."
How was it possible for scientists to determine that helium was present in the sun?,"Each gas has a unique set of spectral lines that serves as a spectroscopic fingerprint.  These lines, incidentally, are created through transitions of electrons from high energy states to low energy states; each transition has a unique amount of energy associated with it which translates to a photon of a particular wavelength.  Helium was discovered by subtracting out all the spectral absorption lines associated with known elements from the solar emmision spectrum, similar to the way an audio technician can enhance a vocal track by subtracting instrumental tracks one at a time.  Hope that helps!"

Since you see the blue light from everywhere overhead, the sky looks blue. \nAs you look closer to the horizon, the sky appears much paler in color. To reach you, the scattered blue light must pass through more air. Some of it gets scattered away again in other directions. Less blue light reaches your eyes. The color of the sky near the horizon appears paler or white."
Do you believe that it is possible that aliens (extra terrestrials) genetically engineered humans in a lab?,"I think that an advanced biotechnology might be able to copy the human model, but it would be a lot more complicated to genetically engineer and produce not only the humans but all the rest of the living organisms on earth.\n\nThink of it: if you wanted to colonize a planet, would you engineer a species like ours, or would you make adaptations to your own species?\n\nTerry Pratchett's novel ""Strata"" tells of world builders who create entire planets complete with faked pre-history.

is possible to travel through time??,"The answer is simple: we travel through time constantly.  Is it possible to travel backwards?  Science does not currently know the answer. Travelling backwards would entail travel at speeds greater than c (the speed of light).  But it is a fact that to move any body from rest to that speed requires an infinite amount of energy, which does not exist.  So, the only option is to use a particle which ALWAYS travels faster than c.  This particle is called a tachyon, as predicted by M-Theory, but whether or not such a particle exists is currently speculative.  The tachyon has a negative mass, travels at velocities greater than c, and travels in the opposite direction of time as we do."
Re: A Classical Objection to Modern Physics?,"The same reason nothing you ever observe is affected by the earth revolving.  It's moving at a constant velocity, meaning there is no acceleration and therefore no force (F=ma).  Force is what you feel, which is why you feel pushed toward the back seat of a car when you are accelerating (speeding up) but you don't feel it when you're moving constantly.  Like, in a vehicle, if you throw up a ball, it will come right straight down because if the car is moving at 50 mph, it, you, and the car are all moving at 50 mph.  The bird, us, the air, the tree, the worm.. everything's moving at the velocity of the earth so it is considered ""at rest"" because it is our frame of reference."

Fillibusters can happen the the senate. How about in the house of Reps?,They ended the filibuster in early 1800's
why the moon show the same face?,"The answer is that the Moon's period of revolution (one orbit around the Earth) is the same as the Moon's period or rotation (one spin around it's axis). The result is that the Moon always keeps on side facing the Earth.\n\nThis phenomena is called ""tidal locking"" and occurs because, while the Moon generates tides in the Earth, the Earth also generates a tide in the Moon (in the solid rock). The Moon's tidal budge moves as the Moon rotates. The energy for this, and the gravitational effects from the distortion, lead to a braking effect. The Moon slows down its rotation until it is such that the buldge is on one side always faces the Earth.  Now the tidal bulge is stationary (facing the Earth) and no more braking occurs. \n\nThis is also related to why there are lot more Lunar Mare on the near side than the far side. The Moon's core is shifted slightly towards the Earth, so it was easier for lava seas to form on the near side.\n\nMany other satellites are tidally locked to their planet. Mercury is almost tidally locked to the Sun."

War on Terror?,"Why is it called war on terror. Was it not called war on terrorism just a few months back ? I think that war is built on a lie.

Who cared about the Iraqi peolpe back then supporting there oppressor. \n\nIn a way by being in Iraq at the moment and hopefully building something that will last will bring some ease on US as a nation that before supported the Iraqi peoples opressor. Like clean up there own mess in a way. \n\nBefore people begin jump me and call me anti american I will point out that US wasnt the only nation that supported Saddam in the 80s. But since the question specific relate to US and Iraq I have limited the answer or more correctly my point view in the issue."

what is a blackhole?,"A black hole is a concentration of mass great enough that the force of gravity prevents anything from escaping it except through quantum tunneling behavior (known as Hawking Radiation). The gravitational field is so strong that the escape velocity near it exceeds the speed of light. This implies that nothing, not even light, can escape its gravity, hence the word ""black"". The term ""black hole"" is widespread, even though it does not refer to a hole in the usual sense, but rather a region of space from which nothing can return."

How do you inscribe a reular square in a circle?,"To incribe a regular quadrilateral (ie sqare) into a circle with only a compass and straight edge do the following:\n\n1. Draw a circle. Label the center A.\n\n2. Draw a diameter of the circle by placing your straight edge on the center of the circle. Label the points where the diameter intersects the circle as B and C.\n\n3. Set your compass to a wider amount than you used to draw your circle.\n\n4. Without adjusting your compass, draw a circle with B as the center.  \n\n5. Without adjusting your compass, draw another circle with C as the center. \n\n6. Your two new circles will intersect at two points. Use your straight edge to draw a line through these two points.\n\n7. This new line will intersect the original circle at two points. Label those points as D and E. \n\n8. B, C, D, and E are the corners of your inscribed square. You can use your straight edge to draw the edges of the square.\n\nReason this works:\n\nIn steps 4 through 6, you contructed the perpendicular bisector to the diameter of the original circle.\n \nThis means that segment DE is a diameter of the orignal circle (since it passes through the center of the circle). This also means segment BC and DE form a right angle. \n\nIf you look at triangles BAD and DAC; BA, AD, AC are all radii of the original circle (and thus the same length). Therefore the triangles are exact copies of each other and BD and DC are the same legth. This logic will show you that all the sides are the same length.\n\nAngle DBE inscribes one half of the original circle since DE is the diameter of the circle. This makes DBE a right angle. Similar logic will show you all angles of your square are right angles. \n\nSince your sqare has all equal sides and all equal angles, it is a square."

What sense does it make that factorial of zero is one?,"It is supposed to make perfect sense. Number of ways to arrange 0 things is 1, since there are only one way, doing nothing.\nNot only that, this works nicely when you work with combination. There is also a generalization of factorial in real numbers, and you can also get 0!=1 from the new definition of factorial in real numbers."
how can we calculate the force of the collision & the duration of the collision?,"the formulas it seems your looking for are:\n\np=mv=J=Ft  where p, v, and t actually have a the symbol delta in front of them meaning ""change in""\n\np is momentum which equals mass times the change in velocity and J is impulse which equals force x time.  Because the change in momentum is equal to the impulse, you can usually set mv=Ft.  You should be given the mass and velocity, and either force or the change in time(duration) in order to solve for the other one.  If the question is asking for both, then you probably have to find force first in some other way, then use that formula.  If you need to find the force in some other way, just think about all of Newton's laws and stuff that you've learned and use them with the rest of the information that the problem gives you, and you should be able to come up with something... if not, post the whole question here and ill try to help :)"

How is crude oil formed?,"Crude oil is formed from accumulations of small organisms, mostly phytoplankton and zooplanton that are buried in sediments in both marine and lacustrine (fresh water) environments. Other organic material is mixed in such as spores, pollen, woody material, and other material such as fecal pellets from marine organisms. These materials often settle through the water into an organic-rich mud that is very low in oxygen (anaerobic) so there are few organisms to feed on the material  and it accumulates over long periods of time. Rivers contribute to this process by both delivering large quantities of organic matter, and also large amounts of sediment to bury this organic matter. \n\nOver time these clay-rich sediments are buried under thousands of feet of sediments, dewatered by pressure from the overlying sediment and become shale. As the shale is buried its temperature increases due to geothermal warming. When it reaches temperatures and pressures of 140 degrees F. (60 C) it begins to convert to oil. As temperature increases from continuing burial processes it reachs a temperature where it begins to form natural gas. Both the oil and the gas are gradually expelled from the shale. Typically shales are found in depostional settings where they may be interbedded with sandstones. Sandstones will have higher porosity (more and bigger holes) than shale and the oil and gas will displace salt water that is remaining in the sandstones. Eventually the oil and gas migrates upward through the water and if the overlying structure has formed some sort of a trapping configuration, (like a sandstone overlain by an impervious shale, or a fault that has created a seal against the sandstone, then this becomes an oil reservoir. \n\nA very similar process occurs in carbonate rocks, like limestone and dolomite, except the organic material originates within the carbonate rock in many instances. If the carbonate reef (for example) has been buried by an impervious layer of shale or carbonate mud of a sabkha, it  will become an oil reservoir.  In other instances, the source of the oil will be a shale that is below the carbonate rocks, and the oil will migrate upward into this reservoir."

"An entomologist noted that in the past 5 years in the local forest preserve, the population of bees decreased?","35% of 35 active hives is 35 x 0.35 = 12.25 hives. So if the number of active hives have decreased by 12.25 hives, then the remaining number of active hives is 35 - 12.25 = 22.75 hives. \n\nIt may not be possible to have a partial number of hives, in which case we might say that most likely 23 hives remain (this corresponds to a 34.3% drop in bee population as opposed to 37.1% drop had the number of hives fallen to 22)."
Why is the sweet flavor so good?,"Sweet tastes good because sweetness in fruit is an indicator of ripeness, and ripe fruit is the most nutritious.  So, once upon a time, a sweet tooth was an evolutionary advantage -- those who enjoyed sweetness sought out the most ripe fruit and had the healthiest diets.  With healthier diets, they survived the longest and passed their genes on to the most offspring. \n\nIronic.  Our appreciation for sugar is actually rooted in good nutrition.\n\nToday, we have extracted sugar from fruit, and for a human being it is no longer conducive to a healthy diet.  In fact, our craving for sugar now has the opposite effect."
Who is the next Super Power ?,"To be a super power, a country needed to be very strong militarily, economically and in global values.\n\nThe People's Republic of China is often considered a rising major power due to its large and stable population, its rapidly growing economy, and its rapidly growing military spending and capabilities.\n\nSimilar to China, India has a population of over one billion, nuclear weapons, the world's 2nd largest land-force and 4th largest airforce, as well as a thriving economy (4th largest in PPP). India also enjoys the advantage of a large and well-educated English-speaking workforce. The biggest obstacle: India is still a ""developing"" country in many respects with poor infrastructure, a huge poor and under-educated lower class that has a tremendous gap with the middle and upper classes; widespread corruption, brain-drain, social and ethnic tensions as well as potential conflict with its neighbor and rival, Pakistan. Despite India's widespread poverty, the Indian middle class consists of approximately 200 million people and poverty levels have been falling consistently since the '90s, though in rural areas, where most Indians still live, there has been little improvement. Today, approximately 20% of India's population lives in absolute poverty. It is thought that India's democratic foundations ensure some kind of long term government stability.\n\nRussia still possesses some attributes of a world power, notably including the world's largest arsenal of nuclear weapons, inherited from the USSR. It also has the proven ability to conduct manned space travel. Perhaps most importantly, it is the geographically largest country of the world and has control over a variety of strategic raw materials. Russia still has a clear capacity for destructive force, which in light of the current delicate political situation is not calculable beyond the medium-term. As one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, Russia also has notable political influence in the world. However, Russia's economy is generally thought to be unstable and less competitive on a global scale. The population has been shrinking since the fall of the Soviet Union and is predicted to fall even lower within the next 10 years, due to drastically shortened life expectancies since 1990 and falling birthrates. Life in what was one of the safest places in the world has become rife with danger and insecure for most people. Furthermore, Russia is unable to control Chechen separatism and terrorism that is threatening neighbouring areas in the south and could lead to the break up of the south of the country. Russia is also unable to prevent illegal Chinese immigration into Asian Russia which may cause the eventual loss of that mineral rich region. A major brain drain of Russia's vast coterie of high quality scientists and engineers, a legacy of its excellent Soviet era education system, is also occurring and undermining Russia's long term economic development. Out of control post Soviet corruption diverts vast sums of government resources away from valuable programs. Corruption is also endemic in its business sector."

how much dose it cost to run a pc for 24 7?,"It probably costs about 10 cents per kilowatt-hour to run a PC 24/7, depending where you live.  Most electronic gear is labeled with the power requirements in watts.  Just multiply that by 24 to get the watts per day and divide by 1,000 to get kilowatts.  For example, a 100 watt load times one hour equals 100 watt-hours and multiplied by 24 hours equals 2,400 watt-hours per day.  Dividing 2,400 watt-hours by 1,000 equals 2.4 KW-hours (kilowatt-hours) per day.  This would cost 2.4 time 10 cents or about 24 cents.  Of course, the PC and the monitor each need to be calculated separately.  Also, if the PC is not in constant use it may go into ""sleep mode"" reducing the power drain.  I read that some people never shut off their PC's because re-starting them may subject the chips to frequent power surges reducing chip life.  In the winter, I consider that the power consumed by my PC helps heat the house.  What is the difference between a 1,000 watt electrical load such as the cooking range vs a 1,000 watt electric heater?  Only the location.  Good luck."

Surface area is commonly denoted  for a surface in three dimensions, or  for a region of the plane (in which case it is simply called ""the"" area). \n\n\n\n\nSurface area refers to the summation of the areas of the exposed sides of an object.\n\nUnits\nUnits for measuring surface area include:\n\nsquare metre = SI derived unit \nare = 100 square metres \nhectare = 10,000 square metres \nsquare kilometre = 1,000,000 square metres \nsquare megametre = 1012 square metres \nImperial units, as currently defined from the metre:\n\nsquare foot (plural square feet) = 0.09290304 square metres. \nsquare yard = 9 square feet = 0.83612736 square metres \nsquare perch = 30.25 square yards = 25.2928526 square metres \nacre = 160 square perches or 43,560 square feet = 4046.8564224 square metres \nsquare mile = 640 acres = 2.5899881103 square kilometres \nThe article Orders of magnitude links to lists of objects of comparable surface area.\n\n\nUseful formulae\nArea of a rectangle (and, in particular, a square): length × width \nArea of a triangle: ½ × base × height \nArea of a disk: π × r² \nArea of a sphere: 4 × π × r² \nTotal surface area of a right circular cylinder: 2 × π × r × (h + r) \nLateral surface area of a right circular cylinder: 2 × π × r × h \nTotal surface area of a right circular cone: π × r × (l + r) \nLateral surface area of a right circular cone: π × r × l"
Is there a connection between the phases of the moon and earthquakes or volcanos?,"Yes, there should be a weak connection between phases of the moon and earthquakes or volcanoes.  Both earthquakes and emerging volcanoes depend on growing stress within the earth.  The moon can raise tides both in the crust of the earth and the oceans, affecting weight of water over portions of the earth.  The moon tide can serve as the straw that breaks the camel's back causing an event to happen slightly sooner than it would anyway.  Of course phases of the moon deal with the reflection of the sun's light relative to the positions of the sun, moon and earth.  Because the ocean tides (and crustal tides) also depend on these same positions where the sun either works with or against the moon), the phase of the moon can slightly affect the weight of the straw that breaks the camel's back."
What does a hazard action #5 law mean? I live in monroe county michigan and was involved in an accident?,"The term ""hazard action"" appears nowhere in the Michigan Compiled Law Service.

Is there any treatment for increased levels of 'floaters' in the eyes?,"It's important to get this checked out by an eye doctor. Sometimes people get floaters and it's not big deal, sometimes they go away, sometimes not, and it's not harmful. Other times, it can be a sign of something more serious. If you see any flashes of light, go immediately to a doctor (might even be cause to go to an emergency room) because that is a sign of a detaching retina (which can make you blind). In other cases, the floaters can be caused by something called neovascularization, which means new blood vessels forming in the eye. This really shouldn't happen, and can be corrected with lasers. I'm told it's not very uncomfortable. If you are diabetic,  this is a risk.\n\nSome causes of floaters that I am aware of: neovascularization causing distortions because the new blood vessels may cause a blind spot on the retina (laser treatment is a possibility); a small bleed in the vitreous that casts a shadow on the retina (may resolve in time, but needs to be checked still); the vitrous can pull away from the retina as a person ages, sometimes leaving a bit of debris, more common in people who are myopic (may resolve in time, not much to be done about it, but needs to be checked to make sure there isn't traction pulling on the retina, which can cause a detached retina).\n\nIn any case, just get it checked out right away. If there is a problem, it can probably be treated before it gets worse. Better sooner than later. Good luck."

All you can say, based on the ubiquitious nature of ATP's usage as the main energy carrier throughout most living organisms, is that ATP became the preferred energy carrier very early on in evolutionary time.

who is edison?,"""Thomas Alva Edison (February 11, 1847 – October 18, 1931) was an inventor and businessman who developed many important devices. ""The Wizard of Menlo Park"" was one of the first inventors to apply the principles of mass production to the process of invention. Edison is considered the most prolific inventor, holding 1,093 patents in his name. Some of these inventions were not completely original but improvements of earlier patents (most famously the Light Bulb), and were actually works of his numerous employees. Edison was sometimes criticized for not sharing the credit, but it was understood by his experimenters that all work was the property of their employer. Nevertheless, Edison received patents worldwide, including the United States, United Kingdom, France, and Germany. Edison started the Motion Picture Patents Company, which was a conglomerate of nine major film studios (commonly known as the Edison Trust)."""
What is the religious breakdown for the population of the United States?,"The United States is a very racially diverse country. According to the 2000 census, it has 31 ethnic groups with at least one million members each, and numerous others represented in smaller amounts.\n\nThe majority of Americans descend from white European immigrants who arrived at the establishment of the first colonies (most after Reconstruction). This majority--69.1% in 2000--decreases each year, and is expected to become a plurality within a few decades. The most frequently stated European ancestries are German (15.2%), Irish (10.8%), English (8.7%), Italian (5.6%) and Scandinavian (3.7%). Many immigrants also hail from Slavic countries such as Poland and Russia. Other significant immigrant populations came from eastern and southern Europe and French Canada.\nTop ancestries in 2000.\nEnlarge\nTop ancestries in 2000.\n\nHispanics from Mexico and South and Central America are the largest minority group in the country, comprising 12.5% of the population (2000 census).

Who is uptinson clair?,"Do you mean Upton Sinclair?\n\nUpton Sinclair, Writer  \n\n    * Born: 20 September 1878\n    * Birthplace: Baltimore, Maryland\n    * Died: 25 November 1968\n    * Best Known As: Socialist author of 1906's The Jungle\n\nUpton Beall Sinclair was a prolific American writer known for his affiliation with socialism and famous for his 1906 novel, The Jungle. Sinclair was born in Baltimore, but his family moved to New York when he was a child. When he was a teenager he began writing brief bits for newspapers and magazines. The Jungle was his sixth novel, and its success made him nationally famous. An exposé of the Chicago meatpacking industry, the book helped change national regulations on food preparation and earned him enough money to establish the Helicon Home Colony, a socialist community in New Jersey. Although the community only lasted about a year (it burned down in 1907), Sinclair remained committed to social causes and to exposing the dangerous effects of capitalism in realistic fiction, essays and various other writings. In 1915 he moved to California, where he ran unsuccessfully for public office several times, including running for governor as a Democrat in 1934. In the 1940s Sinclair again had popular success with the ""Lanny Budd"" series of novels, beginning with World's End (1940) and including the Pulitzer Prize-winning Dragon's Teeth (1942). In 1953 Sinclair moved to Arizona, where he continued to write books, including working his 1932 autobiography, American Outpost, into The Autobiography of Upton Sinclair (1962).\n\nHe is not related to Canadian broadcaster Gordon Sinclair.\n\nFOUR GOOD LINKS\n\n    * Upton Sinclair\n      Good general summary of his career\n    * The California EPIC Movement, 1934\n      Historical pieces about Sinclair's bid for governor\n    * Upton Sinclair\n      Letters from Jack London and the text of The Jungle\n    * Upton Sinclair\n      Hyperlinked biographical essay"

"what came first God or dinosaurs, how come the bible does not talk about dinosaurs?","Some of these answers are clear evidence, that God also created brainwashing...\n\nDinosaurs have been extinct for appx.65-70 million years, after an asteroid landed in the Gulf of Mexico near Belize, and put the earth into darkness for 4-6 years. Geologists excavating strata all over the world have proved this. Without light, most plants could not grow, and without vegetation all of the large dinosaurs which depended on this as a food source, died out...\n\nThe first Homo genus (Man) did not arrive until about 2 million years ago, and if you must know, the first members on our ""Family Tree"" were rodents (Mice & Rats). They survived underground long enough, and continued to adapt. That is why we do medical testing on mice, because they are so much like we are, in fact, they are 99% genetically identical to humans...\n\nThe history of Bible stories begins at the earliest 10,000 years ago, and it is basically a history and chronology of recorded human civilizations, from that point in time forwards. The reason Genesis is so vague, is because it is intended to be poetic, not scientific, and because humans were not around 20 Billion years ago when the universe (Heavens)came into existence, nor were we around 4.6 Billion years ago, when our Solar System (earth) was created..."

Wogs got up at 5 am and wore the Wog Uniform of the Day, which was white t-shirt, and pants inside out and backwards, so the zipper was right on your tailbone. Shellbacks could raise their peices of hose (called shillelaghs) at shoulder height to hit wogs, and since the wogs had to be on hands and knees, it was quite a distance."

Because the frequency of the notes are a geometric sequence with a factor of 2^(1/12) between each note, and 2^(n/12) is irrational except for when n is divisible by 12.  There are 12 half-steps in an octave.\n\nThe frequency of A (just below middle C) is 220 Hz.  So the frequency of a note that is one half-step above A is 220*(2^(1/12)).  Two half-steps up is 220*(2^(2/12))."

nonlinear programming?,"A Nonlinear Program (NLP) is a problem that can be put into the form\n\n    minimize   F(x)\n\n    subject to gi(x)  = 0    for i = 1, ..., m1       where m1 >= 0\n               hj(x) >= 0    for j = m1+1, ..., m     where m >= m1\n\nThat is, there is one scalar-valued function F, of several variables (x here is a vector), that we seek to minimize subject (perhaps) to one or more other such functions that serve to limit or define the values of these variables. F is called the ""objective function"", while the various other functions are called the ""constraints"". (If maximization is sought, it is trivial to do so, by multiplying F by -1.)\n\nBecause NLP is a difficult field, researchers have identified special cases for study. A particularly well studied case is the one where all the constraints g and h are linear. The name for such a problem, unsurprisingly, is ""linearly constrained optimization"". If, as well, the objective function is quadratic at most, this problem is called Quadratic Programming (QP). An even more special case of great importance is where the objective function and the constraints are entirely linear; this is called Linear Programming (LP) and is discussed in a separate FAQ list. Another important special case, called unconstrained optimization, is where there are no constraints at all.\n\nOne of the greatest challenges in NLP is that some problems exhibit ""local optima""; that is, spurious solutions that merely satisfy the requirements on the derivatives of the functions. Think of a near-sighted mountain climber in a terrain with multiple peaks, and you'll see the difficulty posed for an algorithm that tries to move from point to point only by climbing uphill. Algorithms that propose to overcome this difficulty are termed ""Global Optimization"".\n\nThe word ""Programming"" is used here in the sense of ""planning""; the necessary relationship to computer programming was incidental to the choice of name. Hence the phrase ""NLP program"" to refer to a piece of software is not a redundancy, although I tend to use the term ""code"" instead of ""program"" to avoid the possible ambiguity. \n\nThe sites below are quite good. If you want a career in Operations Research or Retailing Management, NLP is a gr8 plus to learn"

What is an Erlang?,"The dimensionless unit named the erlang is a statistical measure of telecommunications traffic used in telephony. It is named after the Danish telephone engineer A. K. Erlang, the originator of traffic engineering and queueing theory.\n\nIn the traffic calculation, one Erlang implies a single resource in continuous use (or two channels at fifty percent use, and so on, pro rata). For example, if a bank has two tellers and they are both busy the whole time, that would represent two erlang of traffic.\n\nThe traffic measured in erlang is used to determine if a system is over- or under-provisioned (has too many or too few resources allocated).\n\nThe traffic measured over many busy hours might be used for a T1 or E1 circuit group to determine how many voice lines are in use at the busiest hours. For example, if no more than 12 out of 24 channels are ever in use at any given time, the other 12 might be made available as data channels.\n\nTraffic measured in erlang is used to calculate grade of service (GoS) or quality of service (QoS).\n\nThere are a range of different Erlang formulae, including Erlang B, Extended Erlang B, Erlang C and a related Engset formula to calculate GoS"

why is the sky blue?,"It is called Rayleigh Scattering, or Molecular scattering.  This is primarily caused by oxygen and nitrogen molecules, whose effective diameters are at least 0.1 times smaller than the effected wavelengths.  Rayleigh scattering is most influential at the alitudes above 4.5 km, occuring in what is called the pure atmosphere.  The amount of Rayleigh scattering is highly selective, being inversely proportional to the fourth power of wavelength.  Consequently, invisible ultraviolet radiation, at a wavelength of 0.3 micrometers, is scattered 16 times as readily as red wavelengths at 0.6 micrometers.  In the visible spectrum, blue wavelengths at 0.4 micrometers are scattered about five times as readily as red wavelengths at 0.6 micrometers.  The preferential scattering of blue wavelengths explains why the clear sky appears blue in daylight.  The blue wavelengths reach our eyes from all parts of the sky."

i need to get a visa for someone who lives in the Philippines to come here and marry me. where do i start?,"Contrary to common sense, the quickest way is NOT to marry her in the Philippines. It is usually faster to get her a fiancee visa, and marry when she comes to U.S. (You have to check for the specific country though).\n\nTo start the process, you need to submit the I-129F petition for fiancee visa to the USCIS. The form is at: http://uscis.gov/graphics/formsfee/forms/i-129f.htm\n\nAfter this gets processed, your fiancee can go to a U.S. embassy for an visa interview.\n\nMarriage visa (K3) takes up to a year to process, while fiancee visa (K1) takes much less (~4 months from petition to visa issued in Bangkok, Thailand, different in different countries).\n\nNote that you also have a slightly more difficult/expensive, but potentially faster option of enrolling her in a U.S. college or English study program, and getting her a student visa (F1)"

even though quarks are the smallest indivisible particles they should b made up(see +details 4 cmplt qstn)?,"There is no definite answer to your question, since science has a limit to how small particles it can detect.  The basic theory in this area is that matter is just a standing wave.  A wave has no weight, but when encased in a sphere, it then has mass.  And mass requires weight.  This weight is so infinitesmally small it cannot be detected.  But these spheres, called photons, are held together with other photons making up quarks, which are held together by Glueon, which in turn makes up atoms, etc.  This is all based on the wave/particle duallity of light.  For more info on this, just e-mail me at msm0021@hotmail.com."
what is the length and duration of one revolution of the sun around the center of the milkyway galixy?,"Firstly, the milky way is in a galatic cluster, and that is in a super cluster.  (There's a lot of gravity out there.)  But those structures are too far away to detect sideway movement, only towards or away.  Also, their motion is highly relativistic.  So Galaxy is a natural place to stop.\n\nThe first figure will probably be within the margin of error for the second and third.  So, as I check wikipedia, I see that the sun is orbitting the galaxy at a rate of 217 kilometer per second and the earth is rotating around the sun at 29.783 km/s.  So, this person has traveled somewhere in excess (depending on how many seconds more than 46 years old they are) of 358,242,443,236.8 kilometers, or 222,468,557,250.0528 miles.  \n\nAlso, just as a comment, there is no ""point"" of the big bang.

if i was traveling in a vehicle at the speed of light and turned on the headlights would they work?,"No. well, its absolutely impossible to travel at or faster then the speed of light, but lets pretend you can so i can actually give you an answer to the question. The speed of light is actually the ultimate speed limit to the universe, nothing can travel faster than light, so although you would expect the light to be going at twice the speed of light (you plus the speed of light)it can't because it is physically impossible for even light to travel faster than the speed of light so it would be going slower than you and not reach any path in front of you. Of course, if you turned on your headlights before you started moving, the light would be one step ahead of you.\n\nOf course, still, nothing can go faster then the speed of light because in the formula for time dialation(time slows down for an object moving close to the speed of light) t'=t/sqrt(1-v^2/c^2) where t' is the time passing for an outside observer, t is the time that passes for the object going at the high velocity, v is velocity, speed is the speed of light and ^2 is squared. (note: this formula is definately correct, it's part of einstein's theory of relativity and I've had to derive it myself for class in the past) so if v was bigger than c, you would have a number greater than one and therefore a negative number under a square root, which is impossible."

what is black ice?,"Black ice\nBlack ice is a thin coating of ice on a surface, often a roadway. While not truly black, it is transparent, allowing the usually-black asphalt/Macadam roadway to be seen through it, hence the term.\n\nIt is usually deposited by freezing rain, mist, or fog. Because it contains relatively little entrained air in the form of bubbles, black ice is transparent and thus very difficult to see (as compared to snow, frozen slush, rime ice, or other typical roadway forms of ice). In addition, it often has a matte appearance rather than the expected gloss; and often is interleaved with wet pavement, which is identical in appearance. For this reason it is especially hazardous when driving or walking.\n\nBlack ice may form even when the ambient temperature is several degrees above the NTP freezing point of water. This occurs typically, and treacherously, when terrain contours and/or prevailing wind cause a local steep differential of atmospheric pressure and/or temperature or when the atmosphere has warmed up after a prolonged cold spell that leaves the temperature of the ground (and roadway!) well below the freezing point.\n\nBlack ice also refers to the slick layer that forms on roadways from a light rain after a period without any precipitation. The water mixes with the road dust and oil but doesn't wash away. This leaves the road surface as slick as ice, slicker than just being wet with water. This type of road hazard can occur any time of year, but especially in mostly dry summer months.\n\nIn either case, while definitely a real phenomenon, ""black ice"" may be cited as the cause of a car crash when, in fact, the real root cause may have been excessive speed, inattention, or some other fault on the part of the driver.\n                    & ALSO\n\nIt is a Top Selling Intrusion Detection!

Someone took pictures of me for a homework assignment and now he's selling them. Is this legal?,"As far as I can tell, it is illegal to sell them without your consent.  Under U.S., they can be used for a ""socially useful purpose,"" but I don't see how selling them is useful.  Actually based on this article, you could possibly sue the person who is using your photo, though I doubt that you would get anywhere near the amount this guy got:\n\nA Los Angeles Times article notes that Nestle USA has been ordered to pay US$15.6 million to former model Russell Christoff for using his likeness without permission.\n\nA photo of Christoff appeared on Nestle's Taster's Choice coffee packaging and in advertisements for several years."

How do hydrogen bonds form?,"In chemistry, a hydrogen bond is a type of attractive intermolecular force that exists between two partial electric charges of opposite polarity. Although stronger than most other intermolecular forces, the typical hydrogen bond is much weaker than both the ionic bond and the covalent bond. Within macromolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids, it can exist between two parts of the same molecule, and figures as an important constraint on such molecules' overall shape.\n\nAs the name ""hydrogen bond"" implies, one part of the bond involves a hydrogen atom. The hydrogen must be attached to a strongly electronegative heteroatom, such as oxygen, nitrogen or fluorine, which is called the hydrogen-bond donor. This electronegative element attracts the electron cloud from around the hydrogen nucleus and, by decentralizing the cloud, leaves the atom with a positive partial charge. Because of the small size of hydrogen relative to other atoms and molecules, the resulting charge, though only partial, nevertheless represents a large charge density. A hydrogen bond results when this strong positive charge density attracts a lone pair of electrons on another heteroatom, which becomes the hydrogen-bond acceptor"

What is EEUMA 143?,"it is actually EEMUA 143.  looks like you can buy it for 25 quid.  according to their web site, it is described as below:\n\n143\nRecommendations for Tube End Welding: Tubular Heat Transfer Equipment Part-1 - Ferrous Materials\n\nISBN0 85931 093 0\n£25.00\n\nDate(1985) (formerly OCMA Spec. No. TEW-1)\nThis specification covers recommended procedures for the tube-end welding of tubes ranging from ½ in (15 mm) to 1½ in (40 mm) nominal diameter and from 1.6 mm to 4.1 mm wall thickness to tube plates of 15 mm and over in ferritic and austenitic materials."
how come a chickens lay an egg every day? What will be the biology explanation for it?,"Do you REALLY want to know the answer to this question?\n\nThe answer to why chickens lay eggs is in reproduction. Just as women have monthly cycles of discarded eggs, so do chickens. The eggs you eat are the bi-product of the reproduction cycle in the form of an unfertilized egg. That red spot you might see on occasion, that's a fertilized egg and was the beginning of a chick but plucked from the nest before it had a chance to mature. In most commercial hen houses where chickens are housed in small cages, there are no roosters.\n\nI don't think chickens lay eggs every day and that is why you would usually need more than one if you want eggs on a daily basis, but chickens do lay often."
What's the difference between a frost and a freeze?,"Freeze is a particularly cold spell of weather, a snow storm or an ice storm.  Frost, like snow, is the result of deposition of water vapor in saturated air.  Therefore, you can have a frost-free freezer inside your home."
How can it RAIN when the temperature is 26 degrees F (which is happening right now here in SE Idaho)?,One of two things. The atmosheric temperature is much warmer than the ground air temperature and thus the precipitation doesn't have time to crystalize and freeze. Or your thermometer is broken.

WHAT IS BEING DONE TO PROTECT THE TERROST. FROM........BLOWING UP THE SEWER SYSYTEMS......ANYBODY?,"Minimal protections.  Since most cities are able to reroute sewer systems, it would not be a high priority protected infrastructure."
"what are some sinusodial equations that apply to the real world, ex. moon phases?",Vibration shape of a guitar or violin string.\nWave forms of sound waves.\nWave forms of radio waves.
difference between  ice and snow?,"Both ice and snow are frozen water.  Snow flakes are crystalized.  If you catch a ""fresh"" snowflake in the air with a glove, you can see that it really looks like the pictures of snowflakes - hexagonal, and symmetric.\n\nFor snow to change into ice, it has to melt first (getting rid of that crystalization), and then refreeze."

What is past space?,"There is no 'past' space. Either it goes on forever or it comes to and end and that's it, nothing more. Concepts of infinity and nothing are difficult to wrap your mind around and this is why it's so hard to understand by meer human beings, an organism just barely come out from the tree swingers we once were not so long ago. In fact some of us still do live in the jungle and live a lifestyle not much different from chimps and apes."
